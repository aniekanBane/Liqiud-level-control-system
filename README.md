# Liqiud Level Control System
Design of a liquid level control system to control the water level of a tank

The following information was known about the plant:

## Block reduction
Based on the superposition that there is No 'controller' in the system. The reduced diagram would be the multiplication of the plant tranfer functions:

## Controller
A controller was to be designed to satisfy the following conditions:
- The steady state error of the liquid level in the tank < Â±0.5%.
- Settling time < 1.5s
- %OS < 5%.

## Stability
